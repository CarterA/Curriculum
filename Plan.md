#Teaching Object-Oriented Programming Concepts through the use of  Visual and Physical Metaphors and Demonstrations
**Overview:**  Ever since I saved for and purchased my own laptop at age 8, I’ve been fascinated with technology. Within the past two years I’ve taught myself how to write computer programs, starting with simple scripts that automate repetitive tasks and, more recently, advancing to complex applications to work with video and audio files. While teaching myself the core concepts required for a programmer to understand what they are doing, I realized that there was a need for a curriculum that would teach the same concepts through more creative methods. Reading hundreds of pages of documentation is not-only daunting, but also an inefficient way of teaching. With this in mind, I am going to create and test a curriculum for teaching core programming concepts through the use of metaphors, both visual and physical.

**Guiding Question:**  Is it possible to successfully and efficiently teach object-oriented programming concepts through the use of visual and physical metaphors?  

* * *
**Learning Objectives:** 
 
*	To gain a greater understanding of the philosophy of object-oriented programming.
*	To learn how a curriculum is created.  
* 	To discover how best to test a curriculum, whether it be through teaching a class personally, or observing another teacher attempting to use your curriculum.  

* * *
**Methods of Study:** 
 
* I will spend the first week researching and creating my curriculum:  
	1. Interview D. Leber and plan out the curriculum with him.  
	2. Attempt to create the best possible metaphors for programming concepts.  
	3. Interview S. Stevenson, E. Vulcano, and Z. Fisher regarding these metaphors, and any other ideas or suggestions they may have.  
	4. Revise metaphors and adjust drafts of curriculum accordingly.  
	5. Create a draft of the curriculum before the week’s end.
* I will spend the second week field-testing and revising my curriculum:  
	1. Attempt to teach the curriculum personally, and observe results through a test as well as a recording of the classroom.  
	2. Revise curriculum accordingly, and create a final presentation.

**Documentation of Learning:**

* Documentation board with highlights from the curriculum, test-based statistics, and quotes from teachers and other experts who were interviewed.  
* An area where any visual or physical metaphors will be displayed and explained.

**Initial Resources:**

* Dr. Doug Leber, learning specialist, tutor.  
* Scott Stevenson, published author and programmer.  
* Zach Fisher, computer sciences student at MIT and programmer.  
* Emanuele Vulcano, computer sciences student at Politecnico di Milano, and programmer.
