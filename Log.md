#Daily Logs
##02/20/10
About an hour today was spent setting up the log system and whatnot, and now it should all be working quite well. The mini-challenge time hasn't actually started yet, so I'm just getting a head start setting everything up. This will be the format of the logs, just simple markdown. Alright, cool.

I added the proposal to the repository today, and got it all formatted and up-to-date. Tomorrow is the first official day of work, so here is my plan:

* Jot down some ideas to show to Doug, review MVC papers.  
* Meet with Doug.  
* Work on anything Doug and I talked about, make sure to type it all up.  
* Start doing sketches of some of the curriculum metaphors.  
* Draft the email to send to Scott, Zach, and Emanuele.

This is how I've spent my time today:  

* 9:00 - 10:45 AM:  Reviewing papers about MVC, writing down some ideas and questions to ask Doug (see Notes.md).  
* 11:00 AM - 12:45 PM:  Interviewed and brainstormed with Doug Leber about the project (see Notes.md).  
* 1:20 - 2:25 PM:  Typed up notes from Doug and created a rough plan for the class schedule (see Notes.md).
* 2:25 - 3:00 PM:  Wrote rough drafts of the emails to send to experts.
* 3:00 - 3:10 PM:  Edited and sent out emails to experts.  
* 3:10 - 4:00 PM:  Began writing the first page of the curriculum itself (see Pages/One.md).  

Today went quite well. The meeting with Doug was extremely helpful, and I definitely have plenty to work on. Tomorrow I need to work on the following:

* Setting up a way of testing the curriculum next week.  
* Completing a rough draft of the first page, and at the very least doing page two as well.  
* Drafting illustrations for the first two pages.  
* Planning out some of the first worksheets.

Here is what I've done so far today:  

* Emailed the director of the Computer Magnet program at TJ, asking him if I could come in and test the curriculum next week. Hopefully I'll get a response within a couple days.  
* Got a response from the director at TJ, no dice. Next week is CSAP testing, and it's too short of notice for any teacher anyway.
