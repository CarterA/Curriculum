#Daily Logs
##02/20/10
About an hour today was spent setting up the log system and whatnot, and now it should all be working quite well. The mini-challenge time hasn't actually started yet, so I'm just getting a head start setting everything up. This will be the format of the logs, just simple markdown. Alright, cool.

I added the proposal to the repository today, and got it all formatted and up-to-date. Tomorrow is the first official day of work, so here is my plan:

* Jot down some ideas to show to Doug, review MVC papers.  
* Meet with Doug.  
* Work on anything Doug and I talked about, make sure to type it all up.  
* Start doing sketches of some of the curriculum metaphors.  
* Draft the email to send to Scott, Zach, and Emanuele.
