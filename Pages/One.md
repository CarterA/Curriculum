##Day One - Teacher's Guide  
Begin the class by posing the questions:  "Have you ever wondered how apps are created? How games are made?" Some students may know that it has something to do with code. Some may even already have created games using game creation software. Next you should introduce them to a few iPhone apps (list will be added once it is finished - see Notes.md), try and get a bit of a "wow" factor in, or at least some amusement. Make sure you engage everyone during this early time, getting students excited is crucial to success.  

###Object-Oriented Programming:  An Overview
You need to cover the following points:  

* An object is an abstract concept. The basic idea is that a program is layed out in a modular fashion, with different objects controlling different aspects of the program's behavior.
* Objects can talk to each other through methods or functions (terminology differs based on language).
* Objects have properties, which describe a characteristic of the object. These properties can be set by other objects.
* An object should always have a clear purpose:  keeping the modular design is crucial.  

An excellent way of demonstrating the concept of an object is to use the example of an army in a campaign. There are several different groups of soldiers, and each group has a specific function. For instance, one group is tasked to gather intelligence and report that information back. Another group is assigned to attacking to the West of their current location, and yet another group is responsible for protecting the Northern flank. A final group is stationed on the South coastline of the area, prepared to defend if necessary.  

In this example, each group of soldiers represents an object in an application, which is represented by the army as a whole. In this case, the application's purpose would be to win a war.  

###Model-View-Controller:  An Overview  
You should introduce MVC as a "paradigm", or a "design pattern". It is a way of laying out the code for a program so that it is organized, efficient, and modular. It is the standard design pattern for most object-oriented languages. You need to cover the following points:  

* Every object must **either** be a Model, a View, or a Controller. Merging any of them defeats the purpose.  
* The Model represents data, the View is an interpretation of that data.  
* The Controller handles and interprets user input and updates the Model accordingly.  
* The View polls the model for changes, and updates itself accordingly.  

To demonstrate MVC, you can use the following iPhone apps: (list will be added once it is finished - see Notes.md).
